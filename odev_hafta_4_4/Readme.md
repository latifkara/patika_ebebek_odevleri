# Matrix Transpose

## introduction

To transpose the matrix means to swap the same numbered rows and columns of the matrix. The matrix obtained as a result of this operation is the transpose of the original matrix. At this stage, the transpose (transpose) of a kxn matrix becomes an nxk matrix. For example, suppose we have a matrix A.

## Explanation

I took the row and column values of the given matrix and assigned it as the column and row of the new matrix.

### Output

```java
Matris : 
1   2   3   
4   5   6   
Transpoze : 
1   4   
2   5   
3   6   

```
